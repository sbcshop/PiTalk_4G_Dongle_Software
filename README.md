PiTalk 4G Dongle is a worldwide band industrial grade 4G dongle that supports OS systems such as Windows/Linux and has a downlink throughput of up to 150Mbps and an uplink rate of 50Mbps. It is simple to use 4G network connection on the move by simply connecting it to a laptop, PC, Raspberry Pi, drone, industrial computer, or any IoT host device. Just like PiTalk 4G HAT, it supports 2G/3G/4G network connection, global band. We will provide the drivers for operating systems including Windows/Linux. This will help the users to run their programs and develop their own apps.
